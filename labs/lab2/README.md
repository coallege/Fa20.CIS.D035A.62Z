I don't know how I feel about having all the class design done for me.
On one hand, it's less work for me but isn't that kind of the entire point?

## Personal Information

I took a lot of old Java out of my memory.
It's been nearly two years since I've used some of this stuff.
Learned a bit about reflection even though I haven't used it.
This was my first project to use Gradle and from that, I learned how the vscode
editor integration works. Learned this awful `Class.<T>method()` syntax.
You can't do anything cool with it, though and it might as well not exist.
As for Gradle, overall, not really that impressed with it but at least I kinda
know how it works at the most basic level and it's not super scary for me anymore.

I really whole-assed this PersonalInformation project and probably did way more
than I needed to so I'm gonna step it down for the `CoinToss` one.
