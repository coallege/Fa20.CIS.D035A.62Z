# Submission

## Requirement fulfillment:

Each requirement is fulfilled in it's respective driver, as specified.

1. [driver.Driver1.err.txt](driver.Driver1.err.txt)
2. [driver.Driver2.student_grade.ser](driver.Driver2.student_grade.ser)
3. [driver.Driver3.students.ser](driver.Driver3.students.ser)

## Grading

For ease of grading, I have also made an extra `driver.Viewer`.

```
This class is for ease of grading and also serves
as proof that the files were serialized correctly
Please input the requirement/driver that you would
like to review:
[1] Driver1/Requirement 1
[2] Driver2/Requirement 2
[3] Driver3/Requirement 3
```

Please run `java -classpath "bin" driver.Viewer`.
