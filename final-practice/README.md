# final practice

How well I do on this final determines a large portion of my final grade.
It's really fun when one question on the final matters as much as two weeks of
work.

Given that I've only read like two or three pages of the book I predict
suffering in the near future.
Also, apparently some stuff was taught in lectures and I haven't watched any
because they were a waste of my time.
As they say "If you can't do the time, don't do the time".
